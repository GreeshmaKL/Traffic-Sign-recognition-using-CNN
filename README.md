# Traffic-Sign-recognition-using-CNN
This repository contains a project focused on recognizing traffic signs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is designed to take an input image of a traffic sign and output the corresponding class. This project addresses an image-based classification problem through the application of deep learning techniques.
